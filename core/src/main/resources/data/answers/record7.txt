The term Physics originates from Latin and Greek words that refer to the study of nature, or the natural world. Physicists investigate the properties of matter, energy, and of space and time, and attempt to place them within an explanatory framework. This is a coherent picture of some part of the universe, that provides causal mechanisms for physical effects. It needs to be in agreement with experimental evidence. An explanation that fit the data is called a theory. A theory must make verifiable predictions for observed quantities. Once a theory stands for a long time without successfully being refuted, it becomes a law. Scientific laws are empirical (experimental) while mathematical laws are logical. When physicists attempt to model the universe mathematically, each model has a limited regime of validity
