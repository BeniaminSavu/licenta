One answer that is easy to give and likely correct but perhaps not terribly satisfying is that physics is whatever physicists do and publish in journals.  That's really how I get my sense of what is encompassed in the field. Another is that physics is the systematic study of the physical universe at various scales.  Some physicists called cosmologist look mostly at the big picture.  Others called condensed matter physicists study the interactions in solid materials and surfaces.  Others study the properties of electromagnetic interactions.  Some probe matter on the smallest scales.  The list is long, and the American Physical Society has 14 divisions without exhausting the possibilities. Another way of looking at it is to seek what differentiates physics from the other sciences.  The study of life is not central to physics.  Yet there is overlap between physics and biology, and there is no sharp boundary between the two.
