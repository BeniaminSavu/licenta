Physics is about collecting replicable measurements by observing the universe, and extracting correlations and assigning causation from those measurements with the purpose of maximising the number of verifiable predictions from the simplest possible axiomatic basis. An example: Observing objects fall under specific conditions leads us to the conclusion h=g.t.t/2 where h is the distance fallen from rest at time t, and g is a "constant" of nature. The fuzzy term in this statement is the "specific conditions" of the experiment: when is the result accurate and reliable, and when is it not. Physics is ultimately about removing the requirements for "specific conditions", without adding extra "natural" parameters (constants). But as Richard Muller's excellent answer points out, it is perhaps important to note what is excluded from this statement, rather than what is included: Occam's razor  is perhaps  an inevitable consequence of how physics is done (to explain the largest set of natural data with the smallest number of parameters), rather than inherent in natural law. Or perhaps the underlying simplicity of natural law has led to how we do physics! I suspect the latter.
