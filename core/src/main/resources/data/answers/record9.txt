There are some specialized physicists,  for example called chemists or biologists or solid state physicists or particle physicists, that take a very specific aspect of Nature,  and try to learn all possible tiny details in their field. Then,  there are some Physicists that understand how to put many fields together, and understand them in a grand,  global view that's actually much simpler and predictive of other phenomena of nature.  Unfortunately,  there weren't many. Finally,  there were many physicists that,  studying their small field,  discovered  (sometimes  accidentally)  extremely useful features  of nature,  like the transistor or the radio.  Humanity was particularly grateful,  and remembers them as inventors and innovators.
