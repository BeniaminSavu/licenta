If the observation shows that the result of the experiment contradicts the expectation of the theory then the theory is wrong. If it is in accordance with the expectation then the theory is confirmed by that experiment. However, it is not proved since another experiment can still show that the theory is wrong. Therefore a scientific theory can never be proved in an absolute sense. But if experiments after experiments confirm the theory then naturally our confidence on it will increase. The job of a physicist is to create a mathematical model in our mind to relate various quantifiable observations in a coherent, unified structure with a minimum possible arbitrary elements. To reach that goal initially physicists may arbitrarily divide the phenomena of the whole of experiences to distinct classes and try to make coherent mathematical structure for those individual classes to make our problem easier and tractable. That's why you read physics of electromagnetism or physics of gravity etc. and they are always partial answers and tentative truths. So in a nutshell, physics is that relentless adventure which go towards complete understanding of the relationships of the whole of our known and as yet unknown experiences.
