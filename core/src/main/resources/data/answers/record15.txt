The dictionary definition of physics is �the study of matter, energy, and the interaction between them�, but what that really means is that physics is about asking fundamental questions and trying to answer them by observing and experimenting. To be honest, it�s really difficult to define exactly what physics is. For one, physics keeps changing as we progress and make new discoveries. New theories don't just bring new answers. They also create new questions that might not have even made sense when viewed from within the previous theory of physics.
