Physics is the formulation of mathematical models that represent the behaviour of conceptual objects that are linked by a chain of calculations to observations of apparent objects.  Now days, the 'apparent objects' are most often numbers, graphs and virtual represetations on a computer screen. We say that the mathematical models work when we can use them to predict what will appear on the screen when we conduct some experiment.  The results are often translated into machines that then perform tasks with predictable results.  None of this has anything to do with 'ontology'... the nature of reality/being/non-being. The formulations of physics represent 'fields' and 'forms'.  These exist only as conceptions. Each form is what it is: a circle, a square, a cube, a spiral, a cone... etc.  There is only one of each form... and it never changes.  No one has ever seen these 'pure shapes'.  Take the cube (there is only one).  The known cube has six sides that are all the same.  Any perceived cube has only one-three faces apparent at any time, and they change apparent shape and relation depending upon the viewpoint.
