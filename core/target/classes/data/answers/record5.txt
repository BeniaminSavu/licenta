Physics is just a subject of science, oftenly considered as one of the three main branches of basic sciences (other two are Chemistry and Biology). We start knowing about Physics, and how it is different from other branches of science, when we go to middle school. And then, when we go to high school, we learn some more Physics. After tenth, taking science (rather than arts and commerce) is often considered as a more reputed phenomenon, and when a student takes science, he gets more chance to know about Physics. Sometimes at this stage, it seems like, Physics is a traditional subject. After 12th, most of the students opt for technical courses, like Engineering and Medical. Engineering students do very less or little work on applied physics and of course they never know what Physics actually is. Only few get enough courage to take bachelor degree in science and while doing so, 90% of them get fascinated for Physics and try to get Physics as their major subject. Of course, only a fraction of them really get Physics as major. Those few people are fortunate enough to recognize a hazy, yet true picture of Physics.
