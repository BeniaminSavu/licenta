Let me use a slightly more technical argument. Intro-intro physics will first teach you force. F=ma. (Well, after you learn the kinematics, which is not physics.)  But for advanced physics, you don't start with F=ma. You begin with Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, Schrodinger's, field equation, you name it. It's all about energy of some form. Mind you Energy-Momentum is a 4-vector. They can never be separated completely. So when I say energy, I meant naturally energy-momentum tensor, in the sense of General Relativity. Everything follows some energy equation(s), whichever form you pick. Least action (Lagrangian), shortest geodesics (GR), lowest potential energy (equilibrium), ...
