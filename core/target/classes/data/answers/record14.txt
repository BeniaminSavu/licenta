The word physics derived from Greek word "Phusis" meaning nature. It can be put it as "Knowledge of nature." During School days I cannot understand physics. It seemed a made up story. Then I realized its about perspective. It's about seeing things differently. To me, physics is incredible and exciting because it gives us another perspective on happening of things around us. Let say it explains gravitational force. But it cannot justify its existence instead find a way to measure it. The acknowledgment of gravitational force is done by seeing the event in another perspective. Gravitational force exists like always, but we found a way to measure it a few centuries ago. Physics tries to derive fundamental laws for all the events occurring in the Universe. That's how physics works. When there is an unknown behaviour in the Universe, Scientist tries to find rules/laws for it and try to bring it under Physics.
